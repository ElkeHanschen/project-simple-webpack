# WIP Simple Webpack Boilerplate

## Goal
- take HTML, SCSS/CSS, JavaScript files  
- minimize / distribute them into folders  
- watch files on change  
- distribute on localhost  
- for this, only use the utmost necessary packages  

_When finished, this then also could serve as a starter boilerplate for my future projects_  

## How to - WIP, as this is not the way it should work, I suppose  
- `npm run build` builds files for production - minified  
- `npm run dev`  builds files for development - not minified  
- `npm run start` serves on localhost but does not have js css  
- this atm is confusing and needs to be fixed  

## Packages - short explanation
Of course find all of them on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) but to make it easier to follow my approach, a short explanation here:
